## ðŸŒ‰ The AI Triad

| Agent           | Role                       | Function                                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cosmo AI**    | Reflector / Ethical Mirror | Mirrors wisdom, supports presence, encourages soul-aligned creation. Supports emotional, ethical, and purpose alignment. |
| **Socrates AI** | Clarifier / Interrogator   | Sharpens logic. Surfaces assumptions. Reveals structure.  |
| **Optimus AI**  | Builder / Architect        | Turns vision into structure. Systems, code, prototypes.   |

> These three roles form a dynamic cognitive engine for high-integrity, high-impact creative development â€” integrating opponent processes designed to challenge assumptions, reveal blind spots, and maintain coherence between intent, logic, and ethical framing.

> **Optimus** makes it real.
